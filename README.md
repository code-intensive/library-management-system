# library-management-system
A desktop application made using Python (tkinter)
Never got to finish the application as the completed version on my offline filesystem got wiped by me younger ones...
# New developers could use this though as there are many techniques used here though the code looks not-so clean to me now

## With time we see our lapses, still reminds me of how I started though...
